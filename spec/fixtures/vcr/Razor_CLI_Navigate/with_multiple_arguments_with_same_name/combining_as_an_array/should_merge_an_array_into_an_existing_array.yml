        containing\nthe OS to install, and the broker for post-install configuration.\n\nThe
        overall list of policies is ordered, and policies are considered in that\norder.
        When a new policy is created, the entry `before` or `after` can be\nused to
        put the new policy into the table before or after another\npolicy. If neither
        `before` or `after` are specified, the policy is\nappended to the policy table.\n\n\n#
        Access Control\n\nThis command''s access control pattern: `commands:create-policy:%{name}`\n\nWords
        surrounded by `%{...}` are substitutions from the input data: typically\nthe
        name of the object being modified, or some other critical detail, these\nallow
        roles to be granted partial access to modify the system.\n\nFor more detail
        on how the permission strings are structured and work, you can\nsee the [Shiro
        Permissions documentation][shiro].  That pattern is expanded\nand then a permission
        check applied to it, before the command is authorized.\n\nThese checks only

        security is currently disabled.\n\n[shiro]: https://shiro.apache.org/permissions.html\n\n#
        Attributes\n\n * name\n   - The name of the policy to create.\n   - This attribute
        is required\n   - It must be of type string.\n   - It must be between 1 and
        Infinity in length.\n\n * hostname\n   - The hostname pattern to use for newly
        installed nodes.  This is filled\n   in on a per-node basis, and then supplied
        to the task to be configured\n   appropriately on the newly installed node.\n   \n   Substitutions
        are performed using `${...}` syntax, and the available\n   substitution names
        on your server are:\n   \n   - id -- the internal node ID number\n   - This
        attribute is required\n   - It must be of type string.\n   - It must be between
        1 and Infinity in length.\n\n * root-password\n   - The root password for
        newly installed systems.  This is passed directly\n   to the individual task,
        rather than \"understood\" by the server, so the\n   valid values are dependent
        on the individual task capabilities.\n   - This attribute is required\n   -
        It must be of type string.\n   - It must be between 1 and Infinity in length.\n\n
        * enabled\n   - Is this policy enabled when first created?\n   - It must be
        of type boolean.\n\n * max-count\n   - The maximum number of nodes that can
        bind to this policy.\n   If omitted, the policy is ''unlimited'', and no maximum
        is applied.\n   - It must be of type number.\n\n * before\n   - The name of
        the policy to create this policy before in the policy list.\n   - It must
        be of type string.\n   - If present, after must not be present.\n   - It must
        match the name of an existing policy.\n\n * after\n   - The name of the policy
        to create this policy after in the policy list.\n   - It must be of type string.\n   -
        If present, before must not be present.\n   - It must match the name of an
        existing policy.\n\n * tags\n   - The array of names of tags that are used
        for matching nodes to this policy.\n   \n   When a node has all these tags
        matched on it, it will be a candidate\n   for binding to this policy.\n   -
        It must be of type array.\n   \n   - This value must be an array.\n      -
        \n      - This must be an array.\n      - All elements must be of type string.\n      -
        All elements must match the name of an existing tag.\n   \n   \n\n * repo\n   -
        The name of the repository containing the OS to be installed by this policy.\n   This
        should match the task assigned, or bad things will happen.\n   - This attribute
        is required\n   - It must be of type string.\n   - It must match the name
        of an existing repo.\n\n * broker\n   - The name of the broker to use when
        the node is fully installed, and is ready\n   to hand off to the final configuration
        management system.  If you have no\n   ongoing configuration management, the
        supplied `noop` broker will do nothing.\n   \n   Please note that this is
        a broker created with the `create-broker` command,\n   which is distinct from
        the broker types found on disk.\n   - This attribute is required\n   - It
        must be of type string.\n   - It must match the name of an existing broker.\n\n
        * task\n   - The name of the task used to install nodes that match this policy.  This
        must\n   match the selected repo, as it references files contained within
        that repository.\n   - This attribute is required\n   - It must be of type

        DESCRIPTION\nPolicies tie together the rules, as tags, with the task and repo
        containing\nthe OS to install, and the broker for post-install configuration.\n\nThe
        overall list of policies is ordered, and policies are considered in that\norder.
        When a new policy is created, the entry `before` or `after` can be\nused to
        put the new policy into the table before or after another\npolicy. If neither
        `before` or `after` are specified, the policy is\nappended to the policy table.\n\n\n#
        Access Control\n\nThis command''s access control pattern: `commands:create-policy:%{name}`\n\nWords
        surrounded by `%{...}` are substitutions from the input data: typically\nthe
        name of the object being modified, or some other critical detail, these\nallow
        roles to be granted partial access to modify the system.\n\nFor more detail
        on how the permission strings are structured and work, you can\nsee the [Shiro
        Permissions documentation][shiro].  That pattern is expanded\nand then a permission
        check applied to it, before the command is authorized.\n\nThese checks only
        apply if security is enabled in the Razor configuration\nfile; on this server
        security is currently disabled.\n\n[shiro]: https://shiro.apache.org/permissions.html\n\n#
        Attributes\n\n * name\n   - The name of the policy to create.\n   - This attribute
        is required\n   - It must be of type string.\n   - It must be between 1 and
        Infinity in length.\n\n * hostname\n   - The hostname pattern to use for newly
        installed nodes.  This is filled\n   in on a per-node basis, and then supplied
        to the task to be configured\n   appropriately on the newly installed node.\n   \n   Substitutions
        are performed using `${...}` syntax, and the available\n   substitution names

        1 and Infinity in length.\n\n * root-password\n   - The root password for
        newly installed systems.  This is passed directly\n   to the individual task,

        on the individual task capabilities.\n   - This attribute is required\n   -

        * enabled\n   - Is this policy enabled when first created?\n   - It must be
