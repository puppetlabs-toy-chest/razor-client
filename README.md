# Razor client

This code is still in development mode; that means that we might make
backwards incompatible changes, especially to the database schema which
would force you to rebuild all the machines that Razor is managing. Razor
will become stable RSN.

This is the command line client for the [Razor
server](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server) Please have a look at
the Wiki over there for details, in particular, the [Getting
Started](https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server/wiki/Getting-started)
page contains instructions about installation and setup of the client.
