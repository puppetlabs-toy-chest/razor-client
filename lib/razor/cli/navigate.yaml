# This file helps Razor::CLI::Navigate with a few things by annotating the
# API. Ultimately, this should be something the server provides. But until
# we better understand what sort of annotation we need from the server,
# we'll keep this with the client.
#
# Possible argument types are
#   - json: parse the argument value as a JSON document and use that
#   - boolean: if the argument has no value associated with it, or the value
#              is "true", convert to +true+; everything else gets converted
#              to +false+
