summary: 'Razor is an advanced provisioning application'
description: |
  Razor is an advanced provisioning application which can deploy both bare-metal
  and virtual systems. It's aimed at solving the problem of how to bring new
  metal into a state where your existing DevOps/configuration management
  workflows can take it over.

  This provides the client application gem, used to provide CLI access and control
  to users of razor-server.
